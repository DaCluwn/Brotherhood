<div class="content">
  Hery Bexley is a halfling who is an adept of the Brotherhood.
  She did not share much about her origins, but did tell that she was born and raised in Lifford. 
  From what little information you have, you know that she worked as a Entertainer: a Singer and Dancer. 
  At some point in her life she was reached out to by the Brotherhood and joined their ranks. 
  She has kept a low profile and wasn't very well-known in the secret society before the incident, despite that however she has attained the status of 
  adept before the demise of previous leadership.
