<div class="content">
    Thrinav is a dwarf who is an adept of the Brotherhood.
    He was born into a lower class labourer family in Dunsdon. Since early age he showed uncanny intellect and observation abilities, 
    because of this he was inducted as an acolyte of local Wragmo church, he spent his early childhood learning theology and religion. 
    The future promised to be bright as he was climbing the clergy hierarchy. However his rise was interrupted by a scandal 
    (which he claims was fabricated by the higher ups, of course) leading to his excommunication. After this whole deal he put his 
    talents towards work as a detective/private eye. For reasons unknown he left Dunsdon and moved to Lifford where his aptitude was discovered by 
    The Brotherhood. His work for the Brotherhood included gathering of intelligence and ,to a lesser degree ,giving advice on matters of faith and church.
