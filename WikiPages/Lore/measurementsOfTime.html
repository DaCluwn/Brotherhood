    Unlike in real world the world does not rotate around it's axis or around the sun. the universe works by a Geocentric model <br>
    One rotation of the sun around the earth is considered a day. Like in our world one day is 24 hours, an hour is 60 minutes and a minute is 60 seconds. <br>
    Groups of ten days are called a Tertio(plural same as singular), these replace the concept of a week in our world.<br>
    Three Tertio (30 days) make up a month. all months are uniform.<br>
    Each month is signified by The Moon completing a full cycle of growth and decay: A new month begins on a day of the new moon <br> 
    Year consists of 10 months: Primolun, Seculun, Tetrolun, Quartolun, Quintulun, Sextalun, Septilun, Octolun, Nonolun, Docalun
