<div class="content">
  Twilight Gate is a district nestled within the city of Lifford. Located at the northern entrance of the city, 
  Twilight Gate stands as a prominent landmark with its impressive stone walls and towering gatehouse. 
  The streets are lined with cobblestone, and the facades of the buildings are much more well kempt than those of the Elmwood Sprawl that lies just beyond the walls. 
  Quaint houses, with their sloping roofs and timber-framed exteriors, create a picturesque setting. The district is famous for its hidden courtyards and secret gardens.
  These charming spots offer a respite from the hustle and bustle of city life, allowing residents and visitors to find solace in a tranquil oasis.
  Twilight Gate also boasts an array of shops, cafes, and cozy taverns
