  with numerous guild halls located in the district. Here, merchants and craftsmen gather to showcase their wares, 
  the atmosphere is filled with the buzz of haggling customers. In the heart of Northtown, there is a square where 
  locals and visitors often gather. The square is dominated by a towering stone fountain, adorned with intricate carvings 
  representing mythical creatures and historical figures. Surrounding the fountain, benches provide a resting place for 
  weary travelers, while nearby taverns and eateries offer a chance for refreshment and camaraderie. Northtown also serves 
  as an essential link between the city's fortified walls and the bustling harbor. As a result, it is not uncommon to witness
