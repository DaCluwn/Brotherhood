<div class="Title40px"> Winter District </div>
<div class="content">
  Winter District, nestled within city of Lifford, is an district that holds within its bounds the prestigious and enigmatic Arcane University. 
  Steeped in mystery and ancient wisdom, this district serves as a hub for the study and practice of arcane arts, enchantments, and esoteric knowledge. 
  The district's atmosphere is characterized by a perpetual haze, casting an ethereal aura upon the cobblestone streets and towering structures. 
  The constant presence of fog and mists adds an air of both mystique and foreboding. Tall, ornate lampposts stand sentinel along the thoroughfares, 
  casting their dim, flickering light upon the shadows that dance and shift with the ebb and flow of the district's arcane energies. The architecture 
  of Winter District is grand and imposing, with the Arcane University itself being the focal point. A massive edifice of Gothic design, 
  the university stretches towards the heavens, its spires reaching out as if trying to touch the sky. Its walls, crafted from dark stones and 
  adorned with arcane symbols and inscriptions, give off an otherworldly aura that both inspires and intimidates.
