<div class="content">
    Elmwood Sprawl is a dilapidated and impoverished slum district located in city of Lifford. Nestled outside northern gates of the city,
    this neighborhood stands in stark contrast to the opulence and grandeur found in the more affluent areas. Characterized by decaying buildings,
    crowded and narrow streets, and a general sense of neglect. Crumbling structures line the streets, exuding a sense of eerie desolation.
    The district is mainly comprised of lower-class individuals who struggle to make ends meet. Tightly packed tenements and makeshift dwellings house families,
    often in overcrowded and unsanitary living conditions. The neighborhood's residents often face limited access to clean water, proper sanitation,
    and dependable infrastructure, creating an environment of hardship and despair. Elmwood Sprawl is known for its winding alleyways,
    which serve as both a sanctuary and a hiding place for those looking to evade the watchful eyes of the law. The lack of policing and the prevalence of criminal activity,
    such as petty theft and illicit trade, further contribute to the district's lawlessness and is a constant reminder of the daily hardships faced by its inhabitants.
    Due to the size of Elmwood sprawl it is most often divided into northern and southern regions<br>
