<div class="content">
  The Docks district in the medieval city of Lifford is a bustling area located along the shore of the city.
  As the heart of the city's maritime activities, it serves as a vital hub for trade, commerce, 
  and transportation. The district is characterized by a labyrinth of narrow cobbled streets,
   lined with warehouses, quays, and docks where large merchant ships and smaller vessels are moored.
    The buildings in this area are primarily made of sturdy stone and timber. The scent of saltwater lingers in the air as
     fishermen unload their fresh catches, while merchants and traders bustle about, negotiating deals and exchanging goods.
      The sound of seagulls and the rhythmic lapping of waves against the shore contribute to the atmosphere of the district.
       Sailors share stories of their voyages, while foreign languages intermingle with the local dialect, creating a tapestry of communication<br>
